abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the effect of intensive lipid-lowering treatment on coronary artery calcification in a substudy of a trial recruiting patients with calcific aortic stenosis.
Methods: In a double blind randomised controlled trial, 102 patients with calcific aortic stenosis and coronary artery calcification were randomly assigned by the minimisation technique to atorvastatin 80 mg daily or matched placebo. Coronary artery calcification was assessed annually by helical computed tomography.
Results: 48 patients were randomly assigned to atorvastatin and 54 to placebo with a median follow up of 24 months (interquartile range 24–30). Baseline characteristics and coronary artery calcium scores were similar in both groups. Atorvastatin reduced serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (253\%, p , 0.001) and C reactive protein (249\%, p , 0.001) concentrations whereas there was no change with placebo (27\% and 17\%, p . 0.95 for both). The rate of change in coronary artery calcification was 26\%/year (0.234 (SE 0.037) log arbitrary units (AU)/year; n = 39) in the atorvastatin group and 18\%/year (0.167 (SE 0.034) log AU/year; n = 49) in the placebo group, with a geometric mean difference of 7\%/year (95\% confidence interval 23\% to 18\%, p = 0.18). Serum low density lipoprotein concentrations were not correlated with the rate of progression of coronary calcification (r = 0.05, p = 0.62).
Conclusion: In contrast to previous observational studies, this randomised controlled trial has shown that, despite reducing systemic inflammation and halving serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, statin treatment does not have a major effect on the rate of progression of coronary artery calcification.},

volume = {25},
doi = {10.5551/jat.RV17020},
abstract = {Plaque calcification develops by the inflammation-dependent mechanisms involved in progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Macrophages can undergo two distinct polarization states, that is, pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in progression and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in regression. In plaque progression, predominant M1 macrophages promote the initial calcium deposition within the necrotic core of the lesions, called as microcalcification, through not only vesicle-mediated mineralization as the result of apoptosis of macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but also VSMC differentiation into early phase osteoblasts. On the other hand, in plaque regression M2 macrophages are engaged in the healing response to plaque inflammation. In association with the resolution of chronic inflammation, M2 macrophages may facilitate macroscopic calcium deposition, called as macrocalcification, through induction of osteoblastic differentiation and maturation of VSMCs. Oncostatin M, which has been shown to promote osteoblast differentiation in bone, may play a pivotal role in the development of plaque calcification. Clinically, two types of plaque calcification have distinct implications. Macrocalcification leads to plaque stability, while microcalcification is more likely to be associated with plaque rupture. Statin therapy, which reduces cardiovascular mortality, has been shown to exert its dual actions on plaque morphology, that is, regression of atheroma and increment of macroscopic calcium deposits. Statins may facilitate the healing process against plaque inflammation by enhancing M2 polarization of macrophages. Vascular calcification has pleiotropic properties as pro-inflammatory “microcalcification” and anti-inflammatory “macrocalcification”. The molecular mechanisms of this process in relation with plaque progression as well as plaque regression should be intensively elucidated.},

abstract = {Vascular calciﬁcation is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. The location, density, and conﬂuence of calciﬁcation may change portions of the arterial conduit to a noncompliant structure. Calciﬁcations may also seed the cap of a thin cap ﬁbroatheroma, altering tensile forces on the cap and rendering the lesion prone to rupture. Many local and systemic factors participate in this process, including hyperlipidemia, ongoing inﬂammation, large necrotic cores, and diabetes. Vascular cells can undergo chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation, causing mineralization of membranous bone and formation of endochondral bone. Calcifying vascular cells are derived from local smooth muscle cells and circulating hematopoietic stem cells (especially in intimal calciﬁcation). Matrix vesicles in the extracellular space of the necrotic core serve as a nidus for calciﬁcation. Although coronary calciﬁcation is a marker of coronary atheroma, dense calciﬁcation ({\textgreater}400 HU) is usually associated with stable plaques. Conversely, microcalciﬁcation (often also referred to as spotty calciﬁcation) is more commonly an accompaniment of vulnerable plaques. Recent studies have suggested that microcalciﬁcation in the ﬁbrous cap may increase local tissue stress (depending on the proximity of one microcalciﬁc locus to another, and the orientation of the microcalciﬁcation in reference to blood ﬂow), resulting in plaque instability. It has been proposed that positron emission tomography imaging with sodium ﬂuoride may identify early calciﬁc deposits and hence high-risk plaques.

Background—The latest American Heart Association guidelines suggest that a calcium score (CS) of zero might exclude the need for coronary angiography among symptomatic patients.
Methods—A substudy was made of the CORE64 (Coronary Evaluation Using Multi-Detector Spiral Computed Tomography Angiography Using 64 Detectors) multicenter trial comparing the diagnostic performance of 64-detector computed tomography to conventional angiography. Patients clinically referred for conventional angiography were asked to undergo a CS scan up to 30 days before. Resutls—In all, 291 patients were included, of whom 214 (73\%) were male, and the mean age was 59.3 ± 10.0 years. A total of 14 (5\%) patients had low, 218 (75\%) had intermediate, and 59 (20\%) had high pre-test probability of obstructive coronary artery disease. The overall prevalence of ≥50\% stenosis was 56\%. A total of 72 patients had CS = 0, among whom 14 (19\%) had at least 1 ≥50\% stenosis. The overall sensitivity for CS = 0 to predict the absence of ≥50\% stenosis was 45\%, specificity was 91\%, negative predictive value was 68\%, and positive predictive value was 81\%. Additionally, revascularization was performed in 9 (12.5\%) CS = 0 patients within 30 days of the CS. From a total of 383 vessels without any coronary calcification, 47 (12\%) presented with ≥50\% stenosis; and from a total of 64 totally occluded vessels, 13 (20\%) had no calcium.
Conclusions—The absence of coronary calcification does not exclude obstructive stenosis or the need for revascularization among patients with high enough suspicion of coronary artery},

This study aimed to examine how change in traditional cardiometabolic risk factors related to change in CAC among individuals with detectable subclinical atherosclerosis.
Methods: Latent growth modeling was used to examine change in cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose) related to change in CAC up to an average 4.9-year follow-up in a multi-ethnic cohort of 3398 asymptomatic individuals (57.8\% men) who had detectable CAC (score N 0) at baseline, adjusting for baseline risk factor levels and CAC values, age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking, family history of CVD, income, and use of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and glucose-lowering medications.
Results: Greater declines in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at followup were each associated with greater CAC progression. The observed inverse associations were attributable to greater CAC progression in participants taking antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs who, as expected, had declines in blood pressure and lipid levels, respectively. These inverse associations did not emerge in participants not taking these medications.
Conclusions: Among individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis, the unexpected inverse associations observed between change in blood pressure and lipid levels with CAC progression emphasize the importance of considering medication use, and, when feasible, the severity and duration of disease, in exploring associations between risk factors and CAC change.},

abstract = {Background: Comparison of atherosclerosis and its risk factors among diverse populations may provide insights into the pathogenesis of the disease. We investigated differences in traditional coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors and presence and quantity of coronary artery calciﬁcation (CAC), a marker of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, between two diverse non-Hispanic white populations living in the US.
Methods and results: Members of the Old Order Amish (OOA), a unique culture with a physically active rural lifestyle who rarely use prescription medications, were compared to another non-Hispanic white population with a more typical US lifestyle, Epidemiology of Coronary Artery Calciﬁcation (ECAC), Study participants from Rochester, Minnesota. Although age- and sex-adjusted presence and quantity of CAC in those with detectable CAC were similar between study groups, there were signiﬁcant differences in the distribution of many traditional CAD risk factors. OOA had signiﬁcantly less abdominal adiposity and history of cigarette smoking but a less advantageous lipid proﬁle than ECAC participants. Importantly, after adjusting for CAD risk factors, presence of CAC and quantity of CAC among those with detectable CAC were signiﬁcantly higher among OOA than ECAC participants.

abstract = {Background: Ethnic differences in prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease are well established and are usually attributed to risk factors variation. This study investigates the differences in coronary artery narrowing and coronary calciﬁcation between two age- and gender-matched cohorts of South Asian and Caucasian symptomatic angina patients.
Methods: We identiﬁed 101 symptomatic angina patients of South Asian origin who had undergone CT angiography and calcium scoring, and compared them with 101 age and gender matched Caucasian patients.
Results: South Asians had a greater mean number of arterial segments with both obstructive and non-obstructive plaque than Caucasians (p =0.006 and p =0.0003, respectively) and higher prevalence of triple-vessel disease (p =0.0004). Similarly, South Asians had a higher mean CAC score (p b 0.0001) and the percentage of South Asians with CAC {\textgreater}0 and in all categories of CAC score 100–1000 were also higher, as was the number of arterial segments with calciﬁed and non-calciﬁed plaque. These results were more marked in patients aged {\textgreater}50 but in those ≤50, Caucasians showed a higher mean number of diseased segments (p=0.019), with non-obstructive plaque (p= 0.02), possibly suggesting that Caucasians are likely to have more diffuse atherosclerosis at an earlier age. CAC prevalence and severity in this age-group were not signiﬁcantly different between South Asians and Caucasians.
Conclusion: Despite similar conventional risk factors for CAD, symptomatic South Asians seem to have more aggressive and diffuse arterial calciﬁcation compared to Caucasians. These differences are more profound above the age of 50, suggesting potential genetic or other risk factors yet to be determined.},

abstract = {Background: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is associated with a risk of coronary heart disease. The prevalence and distribution of the CAC score have been examined in Western countries, but few studies have been performed in Asia, and especially in Japan.

Methods: CAC score and risk factors were analyzed in 1834 asymptomatic subjects who underwent lung cancer screening computed tomography.
Results: CAC was present in 26.9\% of all the subjects, 29.8\% of the males, and 17.1\% of the females. In all age groups, the CAC score was higher in males. In multivariate analysis, male gender [odds ratio (OR) 2.461, 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.361–4.452, p = 0.002], aging (OR 1.102, 95\% CI 1.081–1.123, p {\textless} 0.001), dyslipidemia (OR 1.740, 95\% CI 1.216–2.490, p = 0.002), and fasting glucose (OR 1.008, 95\% CI 1.002–1.015, p = 0.012) were signiﬁcantly associated with a CAC score {\textgreater}100.
Conclusion: The results of this study provide a pattern of CAC distribution based on age and gender in asymptomatic Japanese subjects. This pattern was similar to that in Western countries, although the absolute CAC scores were lower. High CAC scores were associated with male gender, aging, dyslipidemia, and fasting glucose.},

doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.488916},
abstract = {Background—Coronary calcification detected by electron beam tomography may improve cardiovascular risk prediction. The technique is particularly promising in the elderly because the predictive power of cardiovascular risk factors weakens with age. We investigated the prognostic value of coronary calcification for cardiovascular events and mortality in a general, asymptomatic population of elderly subjects.
Methods and Results—From 1997 to 2000, electron beam tomography scanning to assess coronary calcification was performed in subjects of the population-based Rotterdam Study. Risk factors were measured by standardized procedures. Coronary calcium scores were available for 1795 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 71 years; range, 62 to 85 years). During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, 88 cardiovascular events, including 50 coronary events, occurred. The risk of coronary heart disease increased with increasing calcium score. The multivariate-adjusted relative risk of coronary events was 3.1 (95\% CI, 1.2 to 7.9) for calcium scores of 101 to 400, 4.6 (95\% CI, 1.8 to 11.8) for calcium scores of 401 to 1000, and 8.3 (95\% CI, 3.3 to 21.1) for calcium scores Ͼ1000 compared with calcium scores of 0 to 100. The predictive value in subjects Ͼ70 years of age was similar. Risk prediction based on the cardiovascular risk factors improved when coronary calcification was added.
Conclusions—Coronary calcification is a strong and independent predictor of coronary heart disease, also in the elderly. Coronary calcification improves prediction of coronary events based on cardiovascular risk factors. Risk stratification by assessment of coronary calcification may have an important role in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease events in the elderly. (Circulation. 2005;112:572-577.)},

abstract = {Objective: Lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (LE-PAD), is strongly related to traditional risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes). We hypothesized that the prevalence of LE-PAD in the absence of traditional CVD risk factors is not negligible, and that this condition would remain associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in other territories.
Methods: In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we classiﬁed participants without any traditional risk factor according to their ankle-brachial index (ABI) into 3 groups: low ({\textless}1.00), normal (1.00–1.30) and high ({\textgreater}1.30) ABI. Coronary or carotid artery diseases were deﬁned by the presence of any coronary artery calciﬁcation (CAC score {\textgreater} 0) or carotid plaque, respectively.
Results: Among the 6814 participants, 1932 had no traditional risk factors. A low- and high ABI were found in 176 (9\%) and 149 (7.8\%) cases, respectively. Lower glomerular ﬁltration rate (OR: 0.88/10 units, p = 0.04) and higher Interleukin-6 levels (OR: 1.42/natural-log unit, p = 0.02) were associated with low ABI. Past smoking (cessation {\textgreater} 10 years) and pulse pressure had borderline association with low ABI. In adjusted models, low-ABI was signiﬁcantly associated with CAC prevalence (OR: 1.22, p {\textless} 0.03). No signiﬁcant association was found with carotid plaque.
Conclusion: In the absence of traditional CVD risk factors, LE-PAD is still common and associated with coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {Background: We investigated the association of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) with body composition and insulin resistance in apparently healthy Korean adults.
Methods: Nine hundred forty-five participants (mean age, 48.9 years; 628 men) in a medical check-up program were selected for analysis. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The CACS was assessed by multidetector computed tomography.
Results: One hundred forty-six subjects (15.4\%) showed coronary artery calcification and 148 subjects (15.7\%) had metabolic syndrome. CACS showed a significant positive correlation with age, fasting glucose level, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, HOMA-IR, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) assessed by BIA. CACS had a negative correlation with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Subjects with high CACS showed significantly higher mean WHRs and lower mean values for lean body mass compared with subjects without coronary artery calcification. In logistic regression analyses with coronary artery calcification as the dependent variable, the highest quartile of WHR showed a 3.125-fold increased odds ratio for coronary artery calcification compared with the lowest quartile after adjustment for confounding variables. When receiver operating characteristics analyses were performed with coronary artery calcification as the result variable, WHR showed the largest area under the curve (AUC) value among other variables except for age and WC in women (AUC=0.696 for WHR, 0.790 for age, and 0.719 for WC in women).
Conclusion: In our study population of apparently healthy Korean adults, WHR was the most significant predictor for coronary artery calcification among other confounding factors, suggesting that it may have implication as a marker for early atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine the predictors of healthy arterial aging.
BACKGROUND Long-term nondevelopment of coronary artery calciﬁcation (persistent CAC ¼ 0) is a marker of healthy arterial aging. The predictors of this phenotype are not known.
METHODS We analyzed 1,850 participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) with baseline CAC ¼ 0 who underwent a follow-up CAC scan at visit 5 (median 9.6 years after baseline). We examined the proportion with persistent CAC ¼ 0 and calculated multivariable relative risks and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for prediction of this healthy arterial aging phenotype.
RESULTS We found that 55\% of participants (n ¼ 1,000) had persistent CAC ¼ 0, and these individuals were signiﬁcantly more likely to be younger, female, and have fewer traditional risk factors (RF). Participants with an ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score) risk score {\textless}2.5\% were 53\% more likely to have healthy arterial aging than were participants with an ASCVD score \$7.5\%. There was no signiﬁcant association between the Healthy Lifestyle variables (body mass index, physical activity, Mediterranean diet, and never smoking) and persistent CAC ¼ 0. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve incorporating age, sex, and ethnicity was 0.65, indicating fair to poor discrimination. No single traditional RF or combination of other risk factors increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve by more than 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS Whereas participants free of traditional cardiovascular disease RF were signiﬁcantly more likely to have persistent CAC ¼ 0, there was no single RF or speciﬁc low-risk RF phenotype that markedly improved the discrimination of persistent CAC ¼ 0 over demographic variables. Therefore, we conclude that healthy arterial aging may be predominantly inﬂuenced by the long-term maintenance of a low cardiovascular disease risk proﬁle or yet to be determined genetic factors rather than the absence of any speciﬁc RF cluster identiﬁed in late adulthood.

We assessed whether markers of acculturation (birthplace and number of US generations) and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease—carotid artery plaque, internal carotid intima-media thickness, and albuminuria—in 4 racial/ethnic groups.
Methods. With data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n=6716 participants aged 45–84 years) and race-speciﬁc binomial regression models, we computed prevalence ratios adjusted for demographics and traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
Results. The adjusted US- to foreign-born prevalence ratio for carotid plaque was 1.20 (99\% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 0.97, 1.39) among Whites, 1.91 (99\% CI= 0.94, 2.94) among Chinese, 1.62 (99\% CI= 1.28, 2.06) among Blacks, and 1.23 (99\% CI = 1.15, 1.31) among Hispanics. Greater carotid plaque prevalence was found among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics with a greater number of generations with US residence (P {\textless} .001) and among Whites with less education and among Blacks with lower incomes. Similar associations were observed with intima-media thickness. There was also evidence of an inverse association between albuminuria and SES among Whites and Hispanics.
Conclusions. Greater US acculturation and lower SES were associated with a higher prevalence of carotid plaque and greater intima-media thickness but not with albuminuria. Maintenance of healthful habits among recent immigrants should be encouraged. (Am J Public Health. 2008;98:1963–1970. doi:10.2105/ AJPH.2007.123844)},

abstract = {Despite recent rapid advances in medical knowledge that have improved survival, conventional medical science's understanding of human health and disease relies heavily on people of European descent living in contemporary urban industrialized environments. Given that modern conditions in high-income countries differ widely in terms of lifestyle and exposures compared to those experienced by billions of people and all our ancestors over several hundred thousand years, this narrow approach to the human body and health is very limiting. We argue that preventing and treating chronic diseases of aging and other mismatch diseases will require both expanding study design to sample diverse populations and contexts, and fully incorporating evolutionary perspectives. In this paper, we first assess the extent of biased representation of industrialized populations in high profile, international biomedical journals, then compare patterns of morbidity and health across world regions. We also compare demographic rates and the force of selection between subsistence and industrialized populations to reflect on the changes in how selection operates on fertility and survivorship across the lifespan. We argue that, contrary to simplistic misguided solutions like the PaleoDiet, the hypothesis of evolutionary mismatch needs critical consideration of population history, evolutionary biology and evolved reaction norms to prevent and treat diseases. We highlight the critical value of broader sampling by considering the effects of three key exposures that have radically changed over the past century in many parts of the world—pathogen burden, reproductive effort and physical activity—on autoimmune, cardiometabolic and other mismatch diseases.},

doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60598-X},
abstract = {Background
Atherosclerosis is thought to be a disease of modern human beings and related to contemporary lifestyles. However, its prevalence before the modern era is unknown. We aimed to evaluate preindustrial populations for atherosclerosis.
Methods
We obtained whole body CT scans of 137 mummies from four different geographical regions or populations spanning more than 4000 years. Individuals from ancient Egypt, ancient Peru, the Ancestral Puebloans of southwest America, and the Unangan of the Aleutian Islands were imaged. Atherosclerosis was regarded as definite if a calcified plaque was seen in the wall of an artery and probable if calcifications were seen along the expected course of an artery.
Findings
Probable or definite atherosclerosis was noted in 47 (34\%) of 137 mummies and in all four geographical populations: 29 (38\%) of 76 ancient Egyptians, 13 (25\%) of 51 ancient Peruvians, two (40\%) of five Ancestral Puebloans, and three (60\%) of five Unangan hunter gatherers (p=NS). Atherosclerosis was present in the aorta in 28 (20\%) mummies, iliac or femoral arteries in 25 (18\%), popliteal or tibial arteries in 25 (18\%), carotid arteries in 17 (12\%), and coronary arteries in six (4\%). Of the five vascular beds examined, atherosclerosis was present in one to two beds in 34 (25\%) mummies, in three to four beds in 11 (8\%), and in all five vascular beds in two (1\%). Age at time of death was positively correlated with atherosclerosis (mean age at death was 43 [SD 10] years for mummies with atherosclerosis vs 32 [15] years for those without; p{\textless}0·0001) and with the number of arterial beds involved (mean age was 32 [SD 15] years for mummies with no atherosclerosis, 42 [10] years for those with atherosclerosis in one or two beds, and 44 [8] years for those with atherosclerosis in three to five beds; p{\textless}0·0001).
Interpretation
Atherosclerosis was common in four preindustrial populations including preagricultural hunter-gatherers. Although commonly assumed to be a modern disease, the presence of atherosclerosis in premodern human beings raises the possibility of a more basic predisposition to the disease.

abstract = {Background: The presence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an independent marker of increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality. However, the predictive value of thoracic aorta calciﬁcation (TAC), which can be additionally identiﬁed without further scanning during assessment of CAC, is unknown.
Methods: We followed a cohort of 8401 asymptomatic individuals (mean age: 53 ± 10 years, 69\% men) undergoing cardiac risk factor evaluation and TAC and CAC testing with electron beam computed tomography. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were developed to predict all-cause mortality based on the presence of TAC.
R∫esults: During a median follow-up period of 5 years, 124 (1.5\%) deaths were observed. Overall survival was 96.9\% and 98.9\% for those with and without detectable TAC, respectively (p {\textless} 0.0001). Compared to those with no TAC, the hazard ratio for mortality in the presence of TAC was 3.25 (95\% CI: 2.28–4.65, p {\textless} 0.0001) in unadjusted analysis. After adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking and family history of premature coronary artery disease, and presence of CAC the relationship remained robust (HR 1.61, 95\% CI: 1.10–2.27, p = 0.015). Likelihood ratio 2 statistics demonstrated that the addition of TAC contributed signiﬁcantly in predicting mortality to traditional risk factors alone ( 2 = 13.62, p = 0.002) as well as risk factors + CAC ( 2 = 5.84, p = 0.02) models.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the presence of TAC was associated with all-cause mortality in our study; this relationship was independent of conventional CVD risk factors as well as the presence of CAC. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

doi = {10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.08.031},
abstract = {It has been proposed that coronary artery calcium (CAC) can be used to estimate an arterial age in adults. Supporting this concept is that chronologic age, as used in cardiovascular risk assessment, is a surrogate for atherosclerotic burden. This measure can provide the patient with a more understandable version of their CAC score (e.g. you are 55 years old, but your arteries are more consistent with an arterial age of 65). We describe a method of estimating arterial age by equating estimated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk for observed age and coronary artery calcium (CAC). Arterial age is then the risk-equivalent of coronary artery calcium. We use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a cohort study of 6814 participants free of clinical cardiovascular disease, followed for an average of 4 years. Estimated arterial age is obtained as a simple linear function of log-transformed CAC. In a model for incident CHD risk controlling for both age and arterial age, only arterial age was significant, indicating that observed age does not provide additional information after controlling for arterial age. Framingham risk calculated using this arterial age is more predictive of short-term incident coronary events than Framingham risk based on observed age (area under the ROC curve 0.75 for Framingham risk based on observed age, 0.79 using arterial age, p=0.006). In conclusion, arterial age provides a convenient transformation of CAC from Agatston units to a scale more easily appreciated by both patients and treating physicians.},

title = {Lifetime {Risks} of {Cardiovascular} {Disease}},
abstract = {Background The lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease have not been reported across the age spectrum in black adults and white adults.
Methods We conducted a meta-analysis at the individual level using data from 18 cohort studies involving a total of 257,384 black men and women and white men and women whose risk factors for cardiovascular disease were measured at the ages of 45, 55, 65, and 75 years. Blood pressure, cholesterol level, smoking status, and diabetes status were used to stratify participants according to risk factors into five mutually exclusive categories. The remaining lifetime risks of cardiovascular events were estimated for participants in each category at each age, with death free of cardiovascular disease treated as a competing event.
Results We observed marked differences in the lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease across risk-factor strata. Among participants who were 55 years of age, those with an optimal risk-factor profile (total cholesterol level, {\textless}180 mg per deciliter [4.7 mmol per liter]; blood pressure, {\textless}120 mm Hg systolic and 80 mm Hg diastolic; nonsmoking status; and nondiabetic status) had substantially lower risks of death from cardiovascular disease through the age of 80 years than participants with two or more major risk factors (4.7\% vs. 29.6\% among men, 6.4\% vs. 20.5\% among women). Those with an optimal risk-factor profile also had lower lifetime risks of fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.6\% vs. 37.5\% among men, {\textless}1\% vs. 18.3\% among women) and fatal or nonfatal stroke (2.3\% vs. 8.3\% among men, 5.3\% vs. 10.7\% among women).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the independent associations of CAC volume and CAC density with incident CVD events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, prospective observational MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), conducted at 6 US field centers of 3398 men and women from 4 race/ethnicity groups; non-Hispanic white, African American, Hispanic, and Chinese. Participants were aged 45-84 years, free of known CVD at baseline, had CAC greater than 0 on their baseline CT, and were followed up through October 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and all CVD events
RESULTS During a median of 7.6 years of follow-up, there were 175 CHD events and an additional 90 other CVD events for a total of 265 CVD events. With both lnCAC volume and CAC density scores in the same multivariable model, the lnCAC volume score showed an independent association with incident CHD, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.81 (95\% CI, 1.47-2.23) per standard deviation (SD = 1.6) increase, absolute risk increase 6.1 per 1000 person-years, and for CVD an HR of 1.68 (95\% CI, 1.42-1.98) per SD increase, absolute risk increase 7.9 per 1000 person-years. Conversely, the CAC density score showed an independent inverse association, with an HR of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.58-0.91) per SD (SD = 0.7) increase for CHD, absolute risk decrease 2.0 per 1000 person-years, and an HR of 0.71 (95\% CI, 0.60-0.85) per SD increase for CVD, absolute risk decrease 3.4 per 1000 person years. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed significantly improved risk prediction with the addition of the density score to a model containing the volume score for both CHD and CVD. In the intermediate CVD risk group, the area under the curve for CVD increased from 0.53 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.59) to 0.59 (95\% CI, 0.54-0.64), P = .02.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE CAC volume was positively and independently associated with CHD and CVD risk. At any level of CAC volume, CAC density was inversely and significantly associated with CHD and CVD risk. The role of CAC density should be considered when evaluating current CAC scoring systems.},

abstract = {Background—Coronary artery calcium (CAC) has been demonstrated to be associated with the risk of coronary heart disease. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) provides a unique opportunity to examine the distribution of CAC on the basis of age, gender, and race/ethnicity in a cohort free of clinical cardiovascular disease and treated diabetes.
Methods and Results—MESA is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate subclinical cardiovascular disease in a multiethnic cohort free of clinical cardiovascular disease. The percentiles of the CAC distribution were estimated with nonparametric techniques. Treated diabetics were excluded from analysis. There were 6110 included in the analysis, with 53\% female and an average age of 62 years. Men had greater calcium levels than women, and calcium amount and prevalence were steadily higher with increasing age. There were significant differences in calcium by race, and these associations differed across age and gender. For women, whites had the highest percentiles and Hispanics generally had the lowest; in the oldest age group, however, Chinese women had the lowest values. Overall, Chinese and black women were intermediate, with their order dependent on age. For men, whites consistently had the highest percentiles, and Hispanics had the second highest. Blacks were lowest at the younger ages, and Chinese were lowest at the older ages. At the MESA public website (http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org), an interactive form allows one to enter an age, gender, race/ethnicity, and CAC score to obtain a corresponding estimated percentile.
Conclusions—The information provided here can be used to examine whether a patient has a high CAC score relative to others with the same age, gender, and race/ethnicity who do not have clinical cardiovascular disease or treated diabetes. (Circulation. 2006;113:30-37.)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated the tremendous potential of using coronary artery calcium (CAC) in addition to traditional risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk prediction. However, to date, no risk score incorporating CAC has been developed.
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to derive and validate a novel risk score to estimate 10-year CHD risk using CAC and traditional risk factors.
METHODS Algorithm development was conducted in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a prospective community-based cohort study of 6,814 participants age 45 to 84 years, who were free of clinical heart disease at baseline and followed for 10 years. MESA is sex balanced and included 39\% non-Hispanic whites, 12\% Chinese Americans, 28\% African Americans, and 22\% Hispanic Americans. External validation was conducted in the HNR (Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study) and the DHS (Dallas Heart Study).
RESULTS Inclusion of CAC in the MESA risk score offered significant improvements in risk prediction (C-statistic 0.80 vs. 0.75; p {\textless} 0.0001). External validation in both the HNR and DHS studies provided evidence of very good discrimination and calibration. Harrell’s C-statistic was 0.779 in HNR and 0.816 in DHS. Additionally, the difference in estimated 10-year risk between events and nonevents was approximately 8\% to 9\%, indicating excellent discrimination. Mean calibration, or calibration-in-thelarge, was excellent for both studies, with average predicted 10-year risk within one-half of a percent of the observed event rate.
CONCLUSIONS An accurate estimate of 10-year CHD risk can be obtained using traditional risk factors and CAC. The MESA risk score, which is available online on the MESA web site for easy use, can be used to aid clinicians when communicating risk to patients and when determining risk-based treatment strategies.

abstract = {Background: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is a measure of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data are limited regarding its relation to other measures of atherosclerosis.
Methods: Among 1812 subjects (49\% female, 21\% black, 14\% Chinese, and 25\% Hispanic) within the population-based Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we examined the cross-sectional relation of AAC with coronary artery calcium (CAC), ankle brachial index (ABI), and carotid intimal medial thickness (CIMT), as well as multiple measures of subclinical CVD.
Results: AAC prevalence ranged from 34\% in those aged 45–54 to 94\% in those aged 75–84 (p {\textless} 0.0001), was highest in Caucasians (79\%) and lowest in blacks (62\%) (p {\textless} 0.0001). CAC prevalence, mean maximum CIMT ≥ 1 mm, and ABI {\textless} 0.9 was greater in those with vs. without AAC: CAC 60\% vs. 16\%, CIMT 38\% vs. 7\%, and ABI 5\% vs. 1\% for women and CAC 80\% vs. 37\%, CIMT 43\% vs. 16\%, and ABI 4\% vs. 2\% for men (p {\textless} 0.01 for all except p {\textless} 0.05 for ABI in men). The substantially greater prevalence for CAC in men compared to women all ages is not seen for AAC. By age 65, 97\% of men and 91\% of women have AAC, CAC, increased CIMT, and/or low ABI. The presence of multi-site atherosclerosis (≥3 of the above) ranged from 20\% in women to 30\% in men (p {\textless} 0.001), was highest in Caucasians (28\%) and lowest in Chinese (16\%) and ranged from 5\% in those aged 45–54 to 53\% in those aged 75–84 (p {\textless} 0.01 to p {\textless} 0.001). Finally, increased AAC was associated with 2–3-old relative risks for the presence of increased CIMT, low ABI, or CAC.
Conclusions: AAC is associated with an increased likelihood of other vascular atherosclerosis. Its additive prognostic value to these other measures is of further interest. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background In white populations, computed tomographic measurements of coronary-artery calcium predict coronary heart disease independently of traditional coronary risk factors. However, it is not known whether coronary-artery calcium predicts coronary heart disease in other racial or ethnic groups.
Methods We collected data on risk factors and performed scanning for coronary calcium in a population-based sample of 6722 men and women, of whom 38.6\% were white, 27.6\% were black, 21.9\% were Hispanic, and 11.9\% were Chinese. The study subjects had no clinical cardiovascular disease at entry and were followed for a median of 3.8 years.
Results There were 162 coronary events, of which 89 were major events (myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease). In comparison with participants with no coronary calcium, the adjusted risk of a coronary event was increased by a factor of 7.73 among participants with coronary calcium scores between 101 and 300 and by a factor of 9.67 among participants with scores above 300 (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Among the four racial and ethnic groups, a doubling of the calcium score increased the risk of a major coronary event by 15 to 35\% and the risk of any coronary event by 18 to 39\%. The areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves for the prediction of both major coronary events and any coronary event were higher when the calcium score was added to the standard risk factors.
Conclusions The coronary calcium score is a strong predictor of incident coronary heart disease and provides predictive information beyond that provided by standard risk factors in four major racial and ethnic groups in the United States. No major differences among racial and ethnic groups in the predictive value of calcium scores were detected.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We sought to examine the independent predictive value of coronary artery calcium detection for coronary outcomes in a non-referred cohort of healthy men and women ages 40 to 50 years.
BACKGROUND Existing studies have suggested that coronary calcium might have incremental predictive value for coronary outcomes above standard coronary risk factors. However, additional data from non-referred and younger populations are needed.
METHODS Participants (n ϭ 2,000; mean age 43 years) were evaluated with measured coronary risk variables and coronary calcium detected with electron beam tomography. Incident acute coronary syndromes and sudden cardiac death were ascertained via annual telephonic contacts, with follow-up (mean, 3.0 Ϯ 1.4 years; range, 1 to 6 years) in 99.2\% of the cohort.
RESULTS Coronary calcium was found in 22.4\% of men and 7.9\% of women. A total of 9 acute events occurred in men at a mean age of 46 years, including 7 of 364 men with coronary calcium (1.95\%) and 2 of 1,263 men without coronary calcium (0.16\%; p Ͻ 0.0001 by log-rank). No events occurred in women. In these men, coronary calcium was associated with an 11.8-fold increased risk for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) (p ϭ 0.002) in a Cox model controlling for the Framingham risk score. Among those with coronary artery calcification, the risk of coronary events increased incrementally across tertiles of coronary calcium severity (hazard ratio 4.3 per tertile). A family history of premature CHD was also predictive of incident events. The marginal cost effectiveness, assuming a 30\% improvement in survival associated with primary prevention among at-risk men, was modeled to be \$37,633 per quality-adjusted life year saved.
CONCLUSIONS In young, asymptomatic men, the presence of coronary artery calcification provides substantial, cost-effective, independent prognostic value in predicting incident CHD that is incremental to measured coronary risk factors.

abstract = {Background—Conventional coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors fail to explain nearly 50\% of CAD events. This study examines the association between electron-beam tomography (EBT) coronary artery calcium (CAC) and cardiac events in initially asymptomatic low- to intermediate-risk individuals, with adjustment for the presence of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, and a history of cigarette smoking.
Methods and Results—The study was performed in 8855 initially asymptomatic adults 30 to 76 years old (26\% women) who self-referred for EBT CAC screening. Conventional CAD risk factors were elicited by use of a questionnaire. After 37Ϯ12 months, information on the occurrence of cardiac events was collected and confirmed by use of medical records and death certificates. In men, events (nϭ192) were associated with the presence of CAC (RRϭ10.5, PϽ0.001), diabetes (RRϭ1.98, Pϭ0.008), and smoking (RRϭ1.4, Pϭ0.025), whereas in women, events (nϭ32) were linked to the presence of CAC (RRϭ2.6, Pϭ0.037) and not risk factors. The presence of CAC provided incremental prognostic information in addition to age and other risk factors.
Conclusions—The association between EBT CAC and cardiac events observed in this study of initially asymptomatic, middle-aged, low to intermediate-risk individuals presenting for screening suggests that in this group, knowledge of the presence of EBT CAC provides incremental information in addition to that defined by conventional CAD risk assessment.

abstract = {Background: Although cardiovascular risk factor levels are substantially different in Caucasians, African-American, Hispanics, and Asians, the relative rates of coronary heart disease in these groups are not consistent with these differences. The objective of the study is to assess the differences in the prevalence and severity of coronary artery calcification, as a measure of atherosclerosis, in these different ethnic groups.
Methods: Electron-beam tomography was performed in 16,560 asymptomatic men and women (Asians = 1336, African-Americans = 610, Hispanics = 1256) aged ≥35 years referred by their physician for cardiovascular risk evaluation. The study population encompassed 70\% males, aged 52 ± 8 years.
Results: Caucasians were more likely to present with dyslipidemia (p {\textless} 0.0001), while African-Americans and Hispanics had a higher prevalence of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension (all p {\textless} 0.001). After adjustment for age, gender, risk factors, and treatment for hypercholesterolemia, compared with Caucasians, the relative risks for men having coronary calcification were 0.64 (95\% CI: 0.48–0.86) in African-Americans, 0.88 (95\% CI: 0.67–1.15) in Hispanics, and 0.66 (95\% CI: 0.55–0.80) in Asians. After similar adjustments, the relative risks for women having coronary calcification, were 1.58 (95\% CI: 1.13–2.19) for African-Americans, 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.66–1.06) in Hispanics, and 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.56–0.89) in Asian women. After adjusting for age and risk factors using multivariable analysis, African-American men were least likely to have any coronary calcium while African-American women had significantly higher OR of any calcification. Asian men and women had significantly lower OR of any calcification. There was no significant difference in prevalence or severity of atherosclerosis between Hispanics and Caucasians, in men or women.
Conclusions: Our study results demonstrate significant difference in the presence as well as severity of calcification according to ethnicity, independent of atherosclerotic risk factors. Results from this study (physician referred) closely parallel the results from MESA (population based, measured risk factors). Ethnic specific data on the predictive value of differing coronary calcium scores are needed.},

abstract = {Background—There is substantial evidence that coronary calcification, a marker for the presence and quantity of coronary atherosclerosis, is higher in US whites than blacks; however, there have been no large population-based studies comparing coronary calcification among US ethnic groups.
Methods and Results—Using computed tomography, we measured coronary calcification in 6814 white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese men and women aged 45 to 84 years with no clinical cardiovascular disease who participated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). The prevalence of coronary calcification (Agatston score Ͼ0) in these 4 ethnic groups was 70.4\%, 52.1\%, 56.5\%, and 59.2\%, respectively, in men (PϽ0.001) and 44.6\%, 36.5\%, 34.9\%, and 41.9\%, respectively, (PϽ0.001) in women. After adjustment for age, education, lipids, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, treatment for hypercholesterolemia, gender, and scanning center, compared with whites, the relative risks for having coronary calcification were 0.78 (95\% CI 0.74 to 0.82) in blacks, 0.85 (95\% CI 0.79 to 0.91) in Hispanics, and 0.92 (95\% CI 0.85 to 0.99) in Chinese. After similar adjustments, the amount of coronary calcification among those with an Agatston score Ͼ0 was greatest among whites, followed by Chinese (77\% that of whites; 95\% CI 62\% to 96\%), Hispanics (74\%; 95\% CI 61\% to 90\%), and blacks (69\%; 95\% CI 59\% to 80\%).
Conclusions—We observed ethnic differences in the presence and quantity of coronary calcification that were not explained by coronary risk factors. Identification of the mechanism underlying these differences would further our understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary calcification and its clinical significance. Data on the predictive value of coronary calcium in different ethnic groups are needed. (Circulation. 2005;111:1313-1320.)},

Although the US subjects showed the lowest prevalence of risk factors they had a higher median (interquartile range) CACS than the Brazilian and the Portuguese cohorts: 4 (0;87), 1 (0;68) and 0 (0;0), respectively (p {\textless} 0.0001). After adjusting for differences in age and cardiovascular risk factors, US men showed higher relative risk ratios of having any CACS than either Brazilian or Portuguese men. Brazilian and US women did not differ as far as risk of CACS although they demonstrated a greater risk than Portuguese women. In this study, significant differences in CACS were detected among three nations in different continents. The CACS differences paralleled the respective cardiovascular mortality rates.},
